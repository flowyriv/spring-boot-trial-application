# spring-boot-trial-application

## used to practice my knowledge of different dependencies in spring

Built out of java almost entirely (outside of SQL), this application tests my use of dependencies on a local database (h2) and made sure to have correctly used crud operations with different classes and inteferaces. Not only this, but I've run tests, exceptionhandlers, and touched on different uses in properties.

There is no interface to this (purely through terminals and the h2 database in the browser + json files)
